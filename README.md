**Pokemon Card Scanner**

This was a weeks work on a web app that takes a image and scans it to identify a pokemon card.

It works by using Tesseract OCR and scanning the image for the #number that is used for the card in the set.

This is then run against "https://pokemontcg.io/" developer API SDK.

The identified card image is returned along with the rarity variations. A user can then select to add to their database.
